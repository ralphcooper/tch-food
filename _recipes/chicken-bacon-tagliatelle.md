  - 6 rashers streaky bacon, sliced
  - 4-6 mushrooms, sliced
  - knob of butter
  - 1tbsp plain flour

  - 400g tagliatelle
  - 1tbsp creme fraiche
  - small bunch parsley, chopped
instructions:
  - Heat a little oil in a large frying pan, add the spring onions and fry for a few minutes. Add the diced chicken and fry, stirring regularly until browned. Add the bacon and mushrooms and fry for a few more minutes until the chicken and bacon are cooked.
  - Meanwhile, bring a pan of salted water to the boil and add the pasta. Cook according to packet instructions.
  - Add a good knob of butter to the chicken pan and melt, then add the flour, stirring so it soaks up all the fat. Cook for a further minute.
  - Add milk, a little at a time until the sauce comes together. Turn down the heat to a low simmer and continue to cook, stirring occasionally.
  - Once the pasta is cooked, add the creme fraiche to the chicken and stir through. Take off the heat and stir through the chopped parsley
  - Serve the sauce on top of the pasta with some parmesan and black pepper if desired, and some seasonal veg on the side.

ingredients: 
  - 1 aubergine
  - 2 courgettes
  - 300g cherry tomatoes
  - 1 onion
  - 2 cloves garlic
  - handful fresh basil
  - 35g plain flour
  - 35g butter
  - 450ml milk
  - nutmeg
  - handful grated parmesan
  - lasagne sheets
  - handful grated mozzarella
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 220°C/gas 8
  - Dice up the aubergine, courgette and onion into 2cm cubes and tip into the roasting tray. Add the tomatoes, piercing each one with a knife to break the skin, and crush in the garlic.
  - Drissle with a 2-3 tbsp oil, mix it all about and season with salt and pepper, then bake in the oven for 30 minutes until the vegetables are catching around the edges.
  - Next make the white sauce. Melt the butter with the flour in a saucepan on a medium heat and cook for 1-2 minutes. Then gradually whisk in the milk, a bit at a time until the sauce comes together. Grate in a little nutmeg, and cook for 5 minutes until thickened (add a little more milk if too thick). Take off the heat and stir in the parmesan.
  - Once the vegetables are done, take them out of the oven and reduce the heat to 180°C/gas 4. In an oven proof dish, layer sauce, vegetables, and then a layer of pasta sheets, repeating and finishing with a layer of sauce on the top. Sprinkle over the grated mozzarella and bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes until golden on top and bubbling nicely.
  - Serve with a green salad, or some other veg like green beans, and garlic bread.

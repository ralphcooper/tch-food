ingredients: 
  - 12 chicken thighs / drumsticks
  - 250 millilitres apple juice
  - 4 tablespoons maple syrup
  - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  - 2 tablespoons soy sauce
  - 2 star anise
  - 1 cinnamon stick (halved)
  - 6 cloves garlic (unpeeled)
instructions:
  - Put the ribs and chicken pieces in a couple of large freezer bags or into a dish.
  - Add the remaining ingredients, squelching everything together well, before sealing the bag or covering the dish.
  - Leave to marinate in the fridge overnight or up to two days.
  - When the marinating time is up, take the dish out of the fridge and preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C Fan/gas mark 6/400ºF.
  - Pour the contents of the freezer bag into one or two large roasting tins (making sure the chicken is skin-side up), place in the oven and cook for about an hour and a quarter, by which time everything should be sticky and glossed conker-brown.
  - Serve with egg fried rice and green veg
